This repository is for the practice of creating infinite loops and lists.

# When it comes to placing in algoritms, num, total sum, and repeated usasge of codes like in the current and pervious models
# That we do now.
# Overall when it comes to this form of code you can make it easier on youself by recording algorithms from previous codes and 
# Place them in similar scenarios that you recognize to save time and edit your algorithm further.
